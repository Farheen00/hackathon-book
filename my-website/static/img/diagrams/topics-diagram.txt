# ROS 2 Topics Communication Diagram

## Description
This diagram shows the publish-subscribe communication pattern in ROS 2 using topics.

## Visual Elements
1. **Publisher Node**: Left-side box labeled "Publisher Node" containing:
   - "Publisher Object"
   - Arrow pointing to topic
   - Message creation process

2. **Topic Channel**: Central oval/cylinder shape labeled "Topic: /chatter"

3. **Subscriber Nodes**: Right-side boxes labeled "Subscriber Node 1" and "Subscriber Node 2", each containing:
   - "Subscriber Object"
   - Arrow from topic to subscriber
   - Message processing

4. **Message Flow**:
   - Arrow from Publisher to Topic (labeled "Message: Hello World #N")
   - Arrows from Topic to each Subscriber (same message content)
   - Timing indicators showing asynchronous communication

5. **DDS Infrastructure**: Background layer showing the middleware that handles message distribution

## Key Relationships
- One publisher can send messages to multiple subscribers
- Subscribers receive messages without knowing the publisher identity
- Publishers send messages without knowing subscriber identities
- Communication is asynchronous and decoupled
- Message types are standardized (e.g., std_msgs/String)
- Quality of Service (QoS) settings can affect delivery guarantees
