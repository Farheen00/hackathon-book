# ROS 2 Services Communication Diagram

## Description
This diagram illustrates the request-response communication pattern in ROS 2 using services.

## Visual Elements
1. **Service Client**: Left-side box labeled "Service Client" containing:
   - "Client Object"
   - Request creation process
   - Arrow pointing to service

2. **Service Server**: Right-side box labeled "Service Server" containing:
   - "Service Object"
   - Request processing function
   - Response creation process
   - Arrow from service to client

3. **Service Interface**: Central element labeled "Service: /add_two_ints" with:
   - Request message structure (a: int64, b: int64)
   - Response message structure (sum: int64)

4. **Message Flow**:
   - Arrow from Client to Server: "Request: a=2, b=3"
   - Arrow from Server to Client: "Response: sum=5"
   - Synchronous communication indicator (dotted lines showing request-response correlation)

5. **DDS Infrastructure**: Background layer showing the middleware that handles request-response matching

## Key Relationships
- Service client sends a request and waits for a response
- Service server processes the request and returns a response
- Communication is synchronous (client blocks until response received)
- Service interface defines both request and response message types
- One service server can handle requests from multiple clients sequentially
- Client and server must agree on service type and interface
