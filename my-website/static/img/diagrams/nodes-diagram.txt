# ROS 2 Node Architecture Diagram

## Description
This diagram illustrates the architecture and communication patterns of ROS 2 nodes.

## Visual Elements
1. **Central Node Box**: A rectangular box labeled "ROS 2 Node" in the center
2. **rclpy Layer**: A horizontal band above the node labeled "rclpy (Python Client Library)"
3. **Node Components**: Inside the central box:
   - "Node Class" - main class definition
   - "Publishers" - multiple publisher objects
   - "Subscribers" - multiple subscriber objects
   - "Services" - service server/client objects
   - "Timers" - timer callback objects
4. **Communication Arrows**:
   - Bidirectional arrows connecting to "Topics" (bubbles labeled "Topic A", "Topic B")
   - Bidirectional arrows connecting to "Services" (bubbles labeled "Service 1", "Service 2")
5. **External Nodes**: Other node boxes showing similar structure, connected via topics and services
6. **DDS Layer**: Bottom layer showing "DDS (Data Distribution Service)" with connections to all nodes

## Key Relationships
- rclpy acts as the interface between Python code and ROS 2 middleware
- Nodes communicate through topics (publish/subscribe) and services (request/response)
- All communication goes through the DDS layer for distribution
- Nodes are independent processes that can run on different machines
