# URDF Structure Diagram

## Description
This diagram shows the hierarchical structure of a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file for robot modeling.

## Visual Elements
1. **Root Element**:
   - "Robot" container box at the top
   - Contains robot name attribute

2. **Link Elements** (vertical stack):
   - "Link: base_link" box with sub-elements:
     - "Visual" (shape, color, material)
     - "Collision" (collision geometry)
     - "Inertial" (mass, center of mass, inertia tensor)
   - "Link: link2" box with same structure
   - "Link: link3" box with same structure

3. **Joint Elements** (connecting links):
   - "Joint: joint1" box connecting base_link to link2:
     - "Type: revolute" (or other joint type)
     - "Parent: base_link"
     - "Child: link2"
     - "Origin" (position and orientation)
     - "Axis" (rotation axis for revolute joints)
     - "Limits" (for revolute/prismatic joints)
   - "Joint: joint2" box connecting link2 to link3

4. **Hierarchical Tree Structure**:
   - Tree-like connection showing parent-child relationships
   - Base link as root, other links as branches
   - Joint elements as connections between nodes

5. **Additional Elements**:
   - "Material" definitions (shared across links)
   - "Transmission" elements (for actuator control)
   - "Gazebo" elements (for simulation-specific properties)

6. **Example Robot Configuration**:
   - Visualization of how links and joints form a physical robot
   - Kinematic chain from base to end effectors

## Key Relationships
- Links represent rigid bodies of the robot
- Joints define how links move relative to each other
- Kinematic tree has single root (base link) with branches
- Each joint connects exactly two links
- URDF describes both visual appearance and physical properties
- Structure enables simulation, visualization, and motion planning
