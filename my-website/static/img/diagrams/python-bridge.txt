# Python-ROS Bridge Architecture Diagram

## Description
This diagram illustrates the integration architecture between Python AI agents and ROS 2 controllers.

## Visual Elements
1. **Left Section - Python AI Agent**:
   - "AI Algorithm" box (e.g., neural network, decision tree, reinforcement learning)
   - "Data Processing" module
   - "Decision Making" module
   - "Sensor Data Processing" module

2. **Middle Section - Bridge Interface**:
   - "Python-ROS Bridge" box containing:
     - "rclpy Node"
     - "Message Converters"
     - "State Management"
     - "Callback Handlers"

3. **Right Section - ROS 2 System**:
   - "ROS 2 Controllers" box containing:
     - "Motion Controller"
     - "Sensor Interface"
     - "Actuator Interface"
     - "Robot Hardware"

4. **Communication Channels**:
   - "Sensor Topics" (e.g., /scan, /camera/image_raw, /imu/data)
   - "Control Topics" (e.g., /cmd_vel, /joint_commands)
   - "Service Calls" (e.g., /move_to_pose, /get_robot_state)
   - Bidirectional arrows showing data flow

5. **Data Flow Examples**:
   - Sensor data flowing from ROS to Python AI
   - Control commands flowing from Python AI to ROS
   - Feedback loops for closed-loop control

6. **Integration Points**:
   - "Perception Pipeline" connecting sensor data to AI
   - "Action Selection" from AI to control commands
   - "Learning Component" with experience replay buffer

## Key Relationships
- Python AI processes sensor data and makes decisions
- Bridge converts between Python data structures and ROS messages
- ROS controllers execute commands on physical/virtual robot
- Real-time constraints maintained through proper message handling
- Safety layers ensure safe operation between AI and robot
