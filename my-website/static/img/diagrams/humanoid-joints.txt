# Humanoid Robot Joint Structure Diagram

## Description
This diagram illustrates the joint structure and degrees of freedom in a humanoid robot model.

## Visual Elements
1. **Torso/Body**:
   - Central rectangular body with head on top
   - "Base Link" as main reference frame

2. **Head Joint**:
   - "Neck Joint" connecting head to torso
   - Degrees of freedom: pitch, yaw, roll
   - Range of motion indicators

3. **Left Arm Structure**:
   - "Left Shoulder Joint" (3 DOF: pitch, yaw, roll)
   - "Left Elbow Joint" (1 DOF: pitch)
   - "Left Wrist Joint" (2-3 DOF: pitch, yaw, sometimes roll)
   - "Left Hand" end effector

4. **Right Arm Structure** (symmetric to left):
   - "Right Shoulder Joint" (3 DOF)
   - "Right Elbow Joint" (1 DOF)
   - "Right Wrist Joint" (2-3 DOF)
   - "Right Hand" end effector

5. **Left Leg Structure**:
   - "Left Hip Joint" (3 DOF: pitch, yaw, roll)
   - "Left Knee Joint" (1 DOF: pitch)
   - "Left Ankle Joint" (2 DOF: pitch, roll)
   - "Left Foot" end effector

6. **Right Leg Structure** (symmetric to left):
   - "Right Hip Joint" (3 DOF)
   - "Right Knee Joint" (1 DOF)
   - "Right Ankle Joint" (2 DOF)
   - "Right Foot" end effector

7. **Joint Type Indicators**:
   - Revolute joints shown with rotation arrows
   - Range of motion limits indicated with angle brackets
   - Fixed connections where appropriate

8. **Coordinate Frames**:
   - X: Forward direction
   - Y: Lateral direction
   - Z: Upward direction
   - Frame orientation for each joint

## Key Relationships
- Total DOF typically ranges from 20-40 for full humanoid
- Arms usually have 6-7 DOF each
- Legs usually have 6 DOF each
- Head has 3 DOF for orientation
- Joint limits prevent self-collision and ensure physical feasibility
- Kinematic chains enable reaching and locomotion
- Symmetric design for left/right limbs
