# Chapter 2: Python-to-ROS Control Bridge (rclpy)

This chapter focuses on bridging Python agents to ROS controllers using the `rclpy` client library. You'll learn how to integrate Python-based AI agents with ROS 2 systems to create intelligent robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Use the `rclpy` library to create ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Implement bidirectional communication between Python agents and ROS controllers
- Process sensor data in Python and send control commands to robots
- Create custom message types for AI-robot interaction
- Design effective interfaces between AI algorithms and robotic systems

## Sections

This chapter covers:

1. [Introduction to rclpy](./rclpy-intro) - The Python client library for ROS 2
2. [Advanced Publisher-Subscriber Patterns](./publisher-subscriber) - Complex communication patterns
3. [AI-Robot Integration](./ai-robot-integration) - Connecting AI agents with robotic systems

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Chapter 1 (ROS 2 Fundamentals)
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of AI/ML concepts (helpful but not required)

## Overview

The Python-to-ROS bridge is crucial for integrating AI agents with robotic systems. Python is the dominant language for AI and machine learning, while ROS provides the middleware for robotic applications. The `rclpy` library enables seamless integration between these two ecosystems, allowing you to leverage powerful Python-based AI algorithms with ROS 2's robotic capabilities.

This chapter will guide you through practical examples of connecting AI agents to ROS controllers, processing sensor data, and implementing intelligent control strategies for robotic systems.
