# Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module covers the core ROS 2 middleware concepts that form the foundation of robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental ROS 2 concepts: Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Create and run simple ROS 2 nodes using Python
- Bridge Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Understand and author URDF for humanoid robots
- Write simple publishers, subscribers, and services
- Interface Python agents with controllers

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts

## Chapters

This module is divided into three chapters:

1. [ROS 2 Fundamentals: Nodes, Topics, Services](./chapter-1-fundamentals) - Learn the core ROS 2 concepts and communication patterns
2. [Python-to-ROS Control Bridge (rclpy)](./chapter-2-python-bridge) - Bridge Python agents to ROS controllers
3. [Humanoid Robot URDF: Structure, Joints, Links](./chapter-3-urdf-modeling) - Model humanoid robot structures

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this module, ensure you have ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill or Iron Irwini installed on your system. All examples in this module are compatible with these ROS 2 distributions.

Each chapter includes clear explanations, runnable code examples, and text-described diagrams to help you understand the concepts. The content is designed to be accessible at a grade 10-12 level with practical examples that align with official ROS 2 documentation.
