# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! This module focuses on integrating Large Language Models with robotics for autonomous humanoid applications, covering OpenAI Whisper for voice recognition, cognitive planning for natural language processing, and complete system integration.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn:
- How to use OpenAI Whisper for voice command recognition and processing
- How to implement cognitive planning systems that translate natural language to ROS 2 actions
- How to integrate all components into complete autonomous humanoid systems

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Implement OpenAI Whisper integration for voice command recognition
- Create cognitive planning systems that convert natural language to ROS 2 action sequences
- Integrate complete autonomous humanoid systems that execute end-to-end tasks
- Build complete VLA systems that integrate voice recognition, cognitive planning, and autonomous task execution

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completion of Modules 1-3 (ROS 2, simulation, Isaac basics)
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Basic understanding of humanoid robot control concepts

## Chapters

1. [Voice-to-Action: Using OpenAI Whisper for Command Recognition](./chapter-1-whisper-v2a/index) - Learn about voice command recognition and Whisper integration
2. [Cognitive Planning: Converting Natural Language to ROS 2 Action Sequences](./chapter-2-cognitive-planning/index) - Implement cognitive planning for natural language processing
3. [Capstone Integration: Autonomous Humanoid Task Execution](./chapter-3-capstone-integration/index) - Integrate complete autonomous humanoid systems

## Next Steps

Start with Chapter 1 to learn about voice-to-action systems with OpenAI Whisper, then proceed through each chapter in sequence to build a comprehensive understanding of Vision-Language-Action integration.
