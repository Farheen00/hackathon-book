# Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning - Converting Natural Language to ROS 2 Action Sequences

This chapter covers cognitive planning for natural language processing and converting natural language commands into ROS 2 action sequences. You'll learn how to create intelligent systems that understand human instructions and execute appropriate robot behaviors.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create systems that parse natural language commands into actionable robot tasks
- Generate appropriate sequences of ROS 2 actions for robot execution
- Implement cognitive planning algorithms that translate language to action

## Topics Covered

- [Natural Language Processing](./nlp-processing)
- [Action Translation](./action-translation)
- [Planning Algorithms](./planning-algorithms)
