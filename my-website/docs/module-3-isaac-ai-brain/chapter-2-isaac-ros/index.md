# Chapter 2: Isaac ROS - VSLAM and Hardware-Accelerated Perception

This chapter covers implementing Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) and other perception tasks using NVIDIA Isaac ROS with hardware acceleration. You'll learn how to leverage NVIDIA GPU acceleration for real-time perception and localization in robotics applications.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Configure hardware-accelerated perception nodes that leverage NVIDIA GPU acceleration
- Generate accurate 3D maps and robot poses in real-time using VSLAM algorithms
- Implement perception pipelines that demonstrate reliable localization and perception capabilities
- Optimize perception performance using Isaac ROS's specialized nodes
