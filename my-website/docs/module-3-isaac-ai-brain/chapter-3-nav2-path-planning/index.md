# Chapter 3: Nav2 Path Planning - Bipedal Humanoid Navigation

This chapter covers configuring Nav2 for bipedal humanoid robots that generate stable, safe paths while considering balance constraints and step planning requirements specific to bipedal locomotion. You'll learn the unique challenges of navigation for bipedal robots compared to wheeled platforms.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Configure navigation parameters suitable for bipedal robot kinematics
- Plan paths that account for balance and step constraints in dynamic environments
- Implement navigation that maintains stability while following collision-free paths
- Understand the differences between bipedal and wheeled robot navigation
