# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! This module focuses on advanced AI-robotics applications using NVIDIA Isaac, including photorealistic simulation, hardware-accelerated perception, and bipedal navigation.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn:
- How to create photorealistic simulation environments using Isaac Sim
- How to implement hardware-accelerated perception with Isaac ROS
- How to configure Nav2 for bipedal humanoid navigation

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Create Isaac Sim environments with synthetic data generation
- Implement Isaac ROS VSLAM pipelines that demonstrate real-time performance
- Configure Nav2 for bipedal humanoid navigation that accounts for balance constraints
- Integrate Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 components into a complete AI-robot system

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals) and Module 2 (simulation basics)
- Understanding of basic computer graphics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D coordinate systems and transformations
- Access to NVIDIA GPU hardware for Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS

## Chapters

1. [Isaac Sim: Photorealistic Simulation & Synthetic Data](./chapter-1-isaac-sim/index) - Learn about Isaac Sim environments and synthetic data generation
2. [Isaac ROS: VSLAM and Hardware-Accelerated Perception](./chapter-2-isaac-ros/index) - Implement VSLAM and perception pipelines
3. [Nav2 Path Planning: Bipedal Humanoid Navigation](./chapter-3-nav2-path-planning/index) - Configure navigation for bipedal robots

## Next Steps

Start with Chapter 1 to learn about Isaac Sim environments and synthetic data generation, then proceed through each chapter in sequence to build a comprehensive understanding of AI-robotics systems.
