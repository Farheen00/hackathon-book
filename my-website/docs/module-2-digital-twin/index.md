# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book! This module focuses on digital twin development, combining Gazebo physics simulation with Unity visualization to create realistic simulation environments for humanoid robots.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn:
- How to set up realistic physics simulations in Gazebo
- How to create high-fidelity visualization environments in Unity
- How to simulate sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) that produce realistic data patterns
- How to integrate Gazebo and Unity using ROS 2 as middleware

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Create Gazebo worlds with realistic physics parameters
- Design Unity environments with realistic lighting and materials
- Configure simulated sensors that produce realistic data matching real robotics patterns
- Build and test complete digital twin environments that integrate physics simulation and sensor data

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Understanding of basic physics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D coordinate systems
- Basic command-line familiarity

## Chapters

1. [Gazebo Physics Essentials](./chapter-1-gazebo-physics/index) - Learn about gravity, collisions, and robot dynamics
2. [Unity for Humanoid Interaction](./chapter-2-unity-environments/index) - Design high-fidelity scenes and interactions
3. [Simulated Sensors](./chapter-3-sensor-simulation/index) - Implement LiDAR, Depth, and IMU sensor pipelines

## Next Steps

Start with Chapter 1 to learn about Gazebo physics essentials, then proceed through each chapter in sequence to build a comprehensive understanding of digital twin development.
