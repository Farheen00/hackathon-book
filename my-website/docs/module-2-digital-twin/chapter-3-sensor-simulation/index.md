# Chapter 3: Simulated Sensors

This chapter covers simulating sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) to generate realistic sensor data for testing AI algorithms in digital twin environments.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Configure LiDAR sensors that produce realistic point cloud data
- Implement depth camera simulation with realistic depth maps
- Configure IMU simulation with realistic orientation and acceleration data
